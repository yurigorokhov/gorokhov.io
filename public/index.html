        <h1>Yuri Gorokhov</h1>
        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>I am a Software Engineer that loves to design and build products. I am experienced in building fault-tolerant
            distributed systems and data processing pipelines. I am a tinkerer at heart, and have fun playing with data and code (if there is such a distinction). I enjoy building teams that can take a project from ideation to shipped products.</p>

       <p>I seek to work in an environment of passionate engineers who share their ideas freely, and are enabled to take those ideations to market. Most recently I am passionate about Neural Networks & Machine Learning.</p>

        <p>I also nerd out on math on the weekends.</p>
